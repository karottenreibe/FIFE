Just a temporary README that was extracted from a mail of our Mac developer James Lacey, a useful README should be written for Mac users later to replace this version:

I have written up the Mac build instructions here:
http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=Mac_compile_guide.
mac_build.tar.bz2 contains a patch file against SVN containing the
changes I made. It also includes SDLMain.m and SDLMain.h. I put a copy
of both those files in the following directories:

core/src/guimap_test
core/src/mapview_test
core/src/writetest

Also attached are the pkgconfig files (*.pc) that I hacked together so
the SCons script would find the library locations. Up next, I am going
to work on a Universal Binary build and try to make the SCons
configure script more Mac-friendly (if possible).

If anyone finds any mistakes or omissions, please let me know so I can
correct them.

Thanks,
James
